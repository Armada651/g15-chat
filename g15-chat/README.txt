- Description

This plugin adds a G15 applet to ChatZilla that will show messages on any channel,
including private messages and actions.

You can use the first two buttons beneath the display to scroll up and down to see
older message and the last two buttons to scroll left and right to view messages
that do not fit on the display. Hold any of the four buttons for two seconds to
snap back to the most recent message upon release.
