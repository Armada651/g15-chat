Description
==============

This plugin adds a Logitech G15 applet to ChatZilla that will show messages on any channel, including private messages and actions.

Instructions
==============

You can use the first two buttons beneath the display to scroll up and down to see older messages and the last two buttons to scroll left and right to view messages that do not fit on the display. Hold any of the four buttons for two seconds to snap back to the most recent message upon release.
